  file: add_realloc.patch
  description: |
    Blink overrides ArrayBuffer's allocator with its own one, while Node simply
    uses malloc and free, so we need to use v8's allocator in Node. As part of the
    10.6.0 upgrade, we needed to make SerializerDelegate accept an allocator
    argument in its constructor, and override ReallocateBufferMemory and
    FreeBufferMemory to use the allocator. We cannot simply allocate and then memcpy
    when we override ReallocateBufferMemory, so we therefore need to implement
    Realloc on the v8 side and correspondingly in gin.

  file: dcheck.patch
  description: |
    This disables some debug checks which currently fail when running the Electron
    test suite. In general there should be sustained effort to have all debug checks
    enabled. If you want to help, choose one of the diffs below and remove it. Then
    build Electron (debug configuration) and make sure all tests pass on the CI
    systems. Unfortunately the tests don't always cover the check failures, so it's
    good to also run some non-trivial Electron app to verify.

    Apart from getting rid of a whole diff, you may also be able to replace one diff
    with another which enables at least some of the previously disabled checks. For
    example, the checks might be disabled for a whole build target, but actually
    only one or two specific checks fail. Then it's better to simply comment out the
    failing checks and allow the rest of the target to have them enabled.

    Please keep the following lists updated.

    The ELECTRON_NO_DCHECK build flag disables debug checks universally.
    This patch applies the flag to the following GN targets:

      third_party/blink/renderer/core/loader:loader
      url:url

    These files have debug checks explicitly commented out:

      base/memory/weak_ptr.cc
      base/process/kill_win.cc
      components/viz/service/display/program_binding.h
      components/viz/service/display_embedder/server_shared_bitmap_manager.cc

      content/browser/renderer_host/render_widget_host_view_mac.mm
      ppapi/host/ppapi_host.cc
      third_party/blink/renderer/core/dom/node.cc
      third_party/blink/renderer/platform/wtf/text/string_impl.cc

  description: |
    According to electron/electron#3699, it is unreliable to use |unload|
    event for process.exit('exit'), so we have to do that in
    willReleaseScriptContext.

    However Chromium then disallowed scripting in willReleaseScriptContext
    in https://codereview.chromium.org/1657583002, and crash will happen
    when there is code doing that.

    This patch reverts the change to fix the crash in Electron.

  description: |
    Patch the Windows build toolchain to generate unique PDB names

    When the PDB files generated by the `static_library` build are
    packaged for distribution they are all copied to a single folder,
    some of the PDB files have identical names so they end up
    overwriting each other. The missing PDB files cause linker warnings
    when building Electron in Release mode, and make it more difficult
    to debug release builds.

    This patch modifies the PDB naming convention for the
    `static_library` build configuration to ensure PDB names are unique.
    For example, instead of generating `obj/ui/base/base_cc.pdb` the
    build will now generate `obj/ui/base/obj_ui_base_base_cc.pdb`.

  file: disable-redraw-lock.patch
  description:  |
    Chromium uses a custom window titlebar implementation on Windows when DWM
    is disabled (Windows 7 and earlier, non Aero theme). The native titlebar
    sometimes painted over this custom titlebar, so a workaround was put in
    place to lock redraws in reaction to certain events if DWM is disabled,
    since the code assumes that in that case, the custom titlebar is painted.
    Electron forces the use of the native titlebar, which the workaround doesn't
    take into account, and still locks redraws, causing weird repainting issues
    in electron (and other applications). This patch provides a way to disable
    the redraw locking mechanism, which fixes these issues. The electron issue
    can be found at https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/1821

  file: blink_fix_prototype_assert.patch
  description: |
    A recent Chromium change has accidentally added assertion for the case when
    a new window object may not have a prototype attached. In Electron it may
    happen when preventDefault for a native new-window event.
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/f47b361887a31cccf42a6e21a82bccf28372bdaa%5E%21
    In the long term we should investigate why it happened, and take a more
    formal fix. But for now I'm just make this assertion silently pass away.

  file: allow_nested_error_trackers.patch
  description: |
    Only one X11ErrorTracker should exist at a time, but upstream has a bug
    where two can exist if running in headless mode -- 
      ui::(anonymous namespace)::SupportsEWMH() [inner tracker is created]
      ui::WmSupportsHint()
      ui::IsX11WindowFullScreen()
      ui::ScreensaverWindowFinder::IsScreensaverWindow()
      ui::ScreensaverWindowFinder::ShouldStopIterating()
      ui::EnumerateTopLevelWindows()
      ui::ScreensaverWindowFinder::ScreensaverWindowExists() [outer tracker created]
      ui::CheckIdleStateIsLocked()
      ui::CalculateIdleState()
    Removal of either tracker could have side-effects in some code paths,
    so this is probably better handled upstream. This patch tries to do the
    least harm in the interim by removing the check that prevents more than
    one tracker from existing at a time.
