Subject: fix: add default values for variables in common.gypi

common.gypi is a file that's included in the node header bundle, despite
the fact that we do not build node with gyp.

+    # When building native modules using 'npm install' with the system npm,

+    # We set default values here to avoid that error message, even though these
