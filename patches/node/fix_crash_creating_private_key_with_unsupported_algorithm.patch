Subject: fix: crash creating private key with unsupported algorithm

This patch fixes an issue where some calls to crypto.createPrivateKey
made with algorithms unsupported by BoringSSL cause a crash when invoking
methods on their return values. This was happening because BoringSSL
shims some algorithms but doesn't implement them and so attempted to
created keys with them will fail (see https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/boringssl/src/include/openssl/evp.h;l=835-837?q=ed448&ss=chromium)

Node.js returned false in initEdRaw (see: https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/20cf47004e7801ede1588d2de8785c0100f6ab38/src/crypto/crypto_keys.cc#L1106)
but then did nothing with the return value, meaning that if no pkey was
created successfully that a key object was still returned but attempts
to use the data_ field would crash the process as data_ was never
assigned. This is fixed by checking the return value of initEdRaw at the
JavaScript level and throwing an error if the function returns false.

This patch will be upstreamed in some form.
