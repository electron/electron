Subject: build: restore clang as default compiler on macOS

Refs https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/6e0a2bb54c5bbeff0e9e33e1a0c683ed980a8a0f
configures the value at build time which doesn't work in Electron
as it depends on the environment in which the headers got generated from which
cannot reflect the value per platform. It works for Node.js since
node-gyp will use the result of `process.config` that reflects the environment
in which the binary got built.
