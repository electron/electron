Subject: refactor: restore base::AdaptCallbackForRepeating

Undo https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2941842
to reinstate base::AdaptCallbackForRepeating(). It was removed to fix
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=730593 .

We use AdaptCallbackForRepeating() in about a dozen places. This patch
should be removed as soon as those have been updated. Patching because
every instance is a FTBFS that prevents testing any one instance's fix.
