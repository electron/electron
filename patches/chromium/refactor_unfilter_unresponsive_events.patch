Subject: refactor: unfilter unresponsive events

RendererUnresponsive events are filtered out when
* DisableHangMonitor switch is set
* WebContents is awaiting a clipboard scan
* Any remote debugger is attached
* Any local debugger is attached
* Visibility state is not visible
* Renderer process is not initialized

This CL removes these filters so the unresponsive event can still be
accessed from our JS event. The filtering is moved into Electron's code.
