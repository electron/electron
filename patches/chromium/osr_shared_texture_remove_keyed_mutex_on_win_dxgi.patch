Subject: Remove DXGI GMB keyed-mutex

This patch removes the keyed mutex of the d3d11 texture only when the texture is requested by offscreen rendering and on Windows.

The keyed mutex introduce extra performance cost and spikes. However, at offscreen rendering scenario, the shared resources will not be simultaneously read from & written to, typically just one reader, so it doesn't need such exclusive guarantee, and it's safe to remove this mutex for extra performance gain.
