Subject: build_gn.patch

These are variables we add to the root BUILDCONFIG so that they're available
everywhere, without having to import("//electron/.../flags.gni").

Additionally, we add the `:mas_build` config to every compiled file so that
the `MAS_BUILD` #define is available everywhere. This produces fewer patch
conflicts when upgrading than it would if we added a specific config dependency
only to those targets which had MAS_BUILD-relevant content in them. The
tradeoff is that switching from MAS_BUILD to !MAS_BUILD or vice-versa will
rebuild the entire tree.
