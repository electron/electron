Subject: chore: remove conflicting allow_unsafe_libc_calls

We want builds to fail if a buffer warning comes from Electron code but
not from code that we don't maintain (e.g. upstream Chromium code), so
//electron/electron_unsafe_buffer_paths.txt turns off Chromium warnings.

There are some upstream files that generate warnings *and* also have
pragmas that override //electron/electron_unsafe_buffer_paths.txt,
forcing them to be tested. This breaks our build.

Files can be removed from this patch when upstream either removes the
pragma or fixes the other warnings. This patch can be removed when no
files are left.
