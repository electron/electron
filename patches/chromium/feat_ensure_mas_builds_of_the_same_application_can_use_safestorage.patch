Subject: feat: ensure mas builds of the same application can use safestorage

This change ensures that MAS builds of applications with an equivilant darwin build that share the same name do not fight over access to the same Safe Storage account.

Specifically this changes the account name for app "My App" from "My App" to "My App AppStore" if the app is using a MAS build of Electron.

We attempt to migrate the safe storage key from the old account, if that migration succeeds we delete the old key and move on.

Existing apps that aren't built for the app store should be unimpacted, there is one edge case where a user uses BOTH an AppStore and a darwin build of the same app only one will keep it's access to the safestorage key as during the migration we delete the old account.  This is an acceptable edge case as no one should be actively using two versions of the same app.
