Subject: [PATCH] Mitigate bad cast in OffscreenCanvas::GetFontSelector

This change will cause the browser to crash if the execution context
is not a Window or WorkerGlobalScope.  This is a temporary solution
to handle the case where the execution context is an
AudioWorkletGlobalScope.  The longer term solution, which will be
implemented in a follow-up CL, is to block OffscreenCanvas objects from
being transferred to AudioWorklets, as required by the postMessage spec.
