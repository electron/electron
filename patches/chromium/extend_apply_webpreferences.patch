Subject: extend ApplyWebPreferences with Electron-specific logic

On macOS, popup menus are rendered by the main process by default.
This causes problems in OSR, since when the popup is rendered separately,
it won't be captured in the rendered image.
Offscreen can be updated at runtime, as such we need to apply the
turn on/off ExternalPopupMenu in the ApplyPreferences method.
There is no current way to attach an observer to these prefs so patching
is our only option.

Ideally we could add an embedder observer pattern here but that can be
done in future work.
