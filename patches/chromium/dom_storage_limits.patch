Subject: dom_storage_limits.patch

This patch circumvents the restriction on DOM storage objects,
namely `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, which chromium otherwise
limits to approximately 10MiB.

That restriction originates from a recommendation
[in the Web Storage API specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html#disk-space-2)
that is motivated by the concern that hostile code could abuse this
feature to exhaust available storage capacity.
However, in the case of  Electron, where the application developers
have control over all of the code being executed,
this safety precaution becomes a hindrance that does not add much value.
For example, if a malicious developer wanted to consume disk space
on a victim's machine they could do so via Node's native file system API.

By disabling this restriction or increasing the quota,
electron application developers can use `localStorage`
as their application's "back end", without being having
to limit the amount of data stored to 10MiB.

There may still be some benefit to keeping this restriction for applications that load remote content.
Although all remote data should be from a trusted source and transferred using
a secure channel, it is nevertheless advisable to include additional layers of protection
to mitigate risks associated with potential compromise of those other technologies.
With that in mind, an acceptable alternative to disabling the limit at compile-time
(as this patch currently does) would be to instead allow it to be disabled at run-time
for a given `BrowserWindow` via a `webPreferences` option,
similar to [`nodeIntegration`](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security#2-disable-nodejs-integration-for-remote-content).
