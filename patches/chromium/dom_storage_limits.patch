Subject: dom_storage_limits.patch

This patch increases the DOM storage (e.g. `localStorage`
and `sessionStorage`) size quota from 10MiB to 100MiB.
Previous versions of this patch attempted to circumvent
the restriction altogether.
However, this can lead to other problems, such as crashing
the Dev Tools when attempting to read or write values that exceed
`IPC::Channel::kMaximumMessageSize` (128MiB).

Increasing the quota rather than bypassing it reduces the
amount of chromium code that needs to be changed for Electron
as well as keeps these storage areas limited to a bounded
size meanwhile giving application developers more space to work with.
