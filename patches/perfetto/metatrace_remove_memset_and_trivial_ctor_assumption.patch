Subject: metatrace: remove memset and trivial-ctor assumption

Turns out that on MSVC std::atomic<int> is not trivially constructible
(although I think is still a plain old int, it just fails the check).
Fall back on resetting each element individually.
Thankfully the compiler can see through and eventually figures out
it can do a memset: https://godbolt.org/z/wMre8O
