Subject: Merged: [promises, async stack traces] Fix the case when the closure
 has run
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We were using the closure pointing to NativeContext as a marker that the
closure has run, but async stack trace code was confused about it.
