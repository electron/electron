  <button id="new-window">View Demo</button>
  <p>The <code>BrowserWindow</code> module gives you the ability to create new windows in your app. This main process module can be used from the renderer process with the <code>remote</code> module, as is shown in this demo.</p>
  <p>There are a lot of options when creating a new window. A few are in this demo, but visit the <a id="browser-window-link" href="">documentation<span>(opens in new window)</span></a>

            <h2>ProTip</h2>
            <strong>Use an invisible browser window to run background tasks.</strong>
            <p>You can set a new browser window to not be shown (be invisible) in order to use that additional renderer process as a kind of new thread in which to run JavaScript in the background of your app. You do this by setting the <code>show</code> property to <code>false</code> when defining the new window.</p>
            <pre><code><span>var</span> win = <span>new</span> BrowserWindow({
  <span>width</span>: <span>400</span>, <span>height</span>: <span>225</span>, <span>show</span>: <span>false</span>
})</code></pre>
          </div>
    <script>
    // You can also require other files to run in this process
    require('./renderer.js')
  </script>
