_This class is not exported from the `'electron'` module. It is only available as a return value of other methods in the Electron API._

The following example shows how to bounce your icon on the dock.

```js
const { app } = require('electron')
app.dock.bounce()
```

### Instance Methods

#### `dock.bounce([type])` _macOS_

* `type` string (optional) - Can be `critical` or `informational`. The default is
 `informational`

Returns `Integer` - an ID representing the request.

When `critical` is passed, the dock icon will bounce until either the
application becomes active or the request is canceled.

When `informational` is passed, the dock icon will bounce for one second.
However, the request remains active until either the application becomes active
or the request is canceled.

**Note:** This method can only be used while the app is not focused; when the app is focused it will return -1.
