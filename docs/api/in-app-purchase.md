## Methods

The `inAppPurchase` module has the following methods:

### `inAppPurchase.purchaseProduct(productID[, opts])`

* `productID` string
* `opts` Integer | Object (optional) - If specified as an integer, defines the quantity.
  * `quantity` Integer (optional) - The number of items the user wants to purchase.
  * `username` string (optional) - The string that associates the transaction with a user account on your service (applicationUsername).
