Process: [Main](../glossary.md#main-process)

> **Note**
> `BaseWindow` provides a flexible way to compose multiple web views in a
> single window. For windows with only a single, full-size web view, the
> [`BrowserWindow`](browser-window.md) class may be a simpler option.

This module cannot be used until the `ready` event of the `app`
module is emitted.

```js
// In the main process.
const { BaseWindow, WebContentsView } = require('electron')

const win = new BaseWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 })

const leftView = new WebContentsView()
leftView.webContents.loadURL('https://electronjs.org')
win.contentView.addChildView(leftView)

const rightView = new WebContentsView()
rightView.webContents.loadURL('https://github.com/electron/electron')
win.contentView.addChildView(rightView)

leftView.setBounds({ x: 0, y: 0, width: 400, height: 600 })
rightView.setBounds({ x: 400, y: 0, width: 400, height: 600 })
```

## Parent and child windows

By using `parent` option, you can create child windows:

```js
const { BaseWindow } = require('electron')

const parent = new BaseWindow()
const child = new BaseWindow({ parent })
```

The `child` window will always show on top of the `parent` window.

## Modal windows

A modal window is a child window that disables parent window. To create a modal
window, you have to set both the `parent` and `modal` options:

```js
const { BaseWindow } = require('electron')

const parent = new BaseWindow()
const child = new BaseWindow({ parent, modal: true })
```

## Platform notices

* On macOS modal windows will be displayed as sheets attached to the parent window.
* On macOS the child windows will keep the relative position to parent window
  when parent window moves, while on Windows and Linux child windows will not
  move.
* On Linux the type of modal windows will be changed to `dialog`.
* On Linux many desktop environments do not support hiding a modal window.

## Resource management

When you add a [`WebContentsView`](web-contents-view.md) to a `BaseWindow` and the `BaseWindow`
is closed, the [`webContents`](web-contents.md) of the `WebContentsView` are not destroyed
automatically.

It is your responsibility to close the `webContents` when you no longer need them, e.g. when
the `BaseWindow` is closed:

```js
const { BaseWindow, WebContentsView } = require('electron')

const win = new BaseWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 })

const view = new WebContentsView()
win.contentView.addChildView(view)

win.on('closed', () => {
  view.webContents.close()
})
```

Unlike with a [`BrowserWindow`](browser-window.md), if you don't explicitly close the
`webContents`, you'll encounter memory leaks.

## Class: BaseWindow

> Create and control windows.

Process: [Main](../glossary.md#main-process)

`BaseWindow` is an [EventEmitter][event-emitter].

It creates a new `BaseWindow` with native properties as set by the `options`.

### `new BaseWindow([options])`

* `options` [BaseWindowConstructorOptions](structures/base-window-options.md?inline) (optional)

### Instance Events

Objects created with `new BaseWindow` emit the following events:

**Note:** Some events are only available on specific operating systems and are
labeled as such.

#### Event: 'close'

Returns:

* `event` Event

Emitted when the window is going to be closed. It's emitted before the
`beforeunload` and `unload` event of the DOM. Calling `event.preventDefault()`
will cancel the close.

Usually you would want to use the `beforeunload` handler to decide whether the
window should be closed, which will also be called when the window is
reloaded. In Electron, returning any value other than `undefined` would cancel the
close. For example:

```js
window.onbeforeunload = (e) => {
  console.log('I do not want to be closed')

  // Unlike usual browsers that a message box will be prompted to users, returning
  // a non-void value will silently cancel the close.
  // It is recommended to use the dialog API to let the user confirm closing the
  // application.
  e.returnValue = false
}
```

_**Note**: There is a subtle difference between the behaviors of `window.onbeforeunload = handler` and `window.addEventListener('beforeunload', handler)`. It is recommended to always set the `event.returnValue` explicitly, instead of only returning a value, as the former works more consistently within Electron._

#### Event: 'closed'

Emitted when the window is closed. After you have received this event you should
remove the reference to the window and avoid using it any more.

#### Event: 'query-session-end' _Windows_

Returns:

* `event` [WindowSessionEndEvent][window-session-end-event]

Emitted when a session is about to end due to a shutdown, machine restart, or user log-off.
Calling `event.preventDefault()` can delay the system shutdown, though it’s generally best
to respect the user’s choice to end the session. However, you may choose to use it if
ending the session puts the user at risk of losing data.

#### Event: 'session-end' _Windows_

Returns:

* `event` [WindowSessionEndEvent][window-session-end-event]

Emitted when a session is about to end due to a shutdown, machine restart, or user log-off. Once this event fires, there is no way to prevent the session from ending.

#### Event: 'blur'

Returns:

* `event` Event

Emitted when the window loses focus.

#### Event: 'focus'

Returns:

* `event` Event

Emitted when the window gains focus.

#### Event: 'show'

Emitted when the window is shown.

#### Event: 'hide'

Emitted when the window is hidden.

#### Event: 'maximize'

Emitted when window is maximized.

#### Event: 'unmaximize'

Emitted when the window exits from a maximized state.

#### Event: 'minimize'

Emitted when the window is minimized.

#### Event: 'restore'

Emitted when the window is restored from a minimized state.

#### Event: 'will-resize' _macOS_ _Windows_

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `newBounds` [Rectangle](structures/rectangle.md) - Size the window is being resized to.
* `details` Object
  * `edge` (string) - The edge of the window being dragged for resizing. Can be `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left` or `bottom-right`.

Emitted before the window is resized. Calling `event.preventDefault()` will prevent the window from being resized.

Note that this is only emitted when the window is being resized manually. Resizing the window with `setBounds`/`setSize` will not emit this event.

The possible values and behaviors of the `edge` option are platform dependent. Possible values are:

* On Windows, possible values are `bottom`, `top`, `left`, `right`, `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right`.
* On macOS, possible values are `bottom` and `right`.
  * The value `bottom` is used to denote vertical resizing.
  * The value `right` is used to denote horizontal resizing.

#### Event: 'resize'

Emitted after the window has been resized.

#### Event: 'resized' _macOS_ _Windows_

Emitted once when the window has finished being resized.

This is usually emitted when the window has been resized manually. On macOS, resizing the window with `setBounds`/`setSize` and setting the `animate` parameter to `true` will also emit this event once resizing has finished.

#### Event: 'will-move' _macOS_ _Windows_

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `newBounds` [Rectangle](structures/rectangle.md) - Location the window is being moved to.

Emitted before the window is moved. On Windows, calling `event.preventDefault()` will prevent the window from being moved.

Note that this is only emitted when the window is being moved manually. Moving the window with `setPosition`/`setBounds`/`center` will not emit this event.

#### Event: 'move'

Emitted when the window is being moved to a new position.

#### Event: 'moved' _macOS_ _Windows_

Emitted once when the window is moved to a new position.

**Note**: On macOS this event is an alias of `move`.

#### Event: 'enter-full-screen'

Emitted when the window enters a full-screen state.

#### Event: 'leave-full-screen'

Emitted when the window leaves a full-screen state.

#### Event: 'always-on-top-changed'

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `isAlwaysOnTop` boolean

Emitted when the window is set or unset to show always on top of other windows.

#### Event: 'app-command' _Windows_ _Linux_

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `command` string

Emitted when an [App Command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/wm-appcommand)
is invoked. These are typically related to keyboard media keys or browser
commands, as well as the "Back" button built into some mice on Windows.

Commands are lowercased, underscores are replaced with hyphens, and the
`APPCOMMAND_` prefix is stripped off.
e.g. `APPCOMMAND_BROWSER_BACKWARD` is emitted as `browser-backward`.

```js
const { BaseWindow } = require('electron')
const win = new BaseWindow()
win.on('app-command', (e, cmd) => {
  // Navigate the window back when the user hits their mouse back button
  if (cmd === 'browser-backward') {
    // Find the appropriate WebContents to navigate.
  }
})
```

The following app commands are explicitly supported on Linux:

* `browser-backward`
* `browser-forward`

#### Event: 'swipe' _macOS_

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `direction` string

Emitted on 3-finger swipe. Possible directions are `up`, `right`, `down`, `left`.

The method underlying this event is built to handle older macOS-style trackpad swiping,
where the content on the screen doesn't move with the swipe. Most macOS trackpads are not
configured to allow this kind of swiping anymore, so in order for it to emit properly the
'Swipe between pages' preference in `System Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures` must be
set to 'Swipe with two or three fingers'.

#### Event: 'rotate-gesture' _macOS_

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `rotation` Float

Emitted on trackpad rotation gesture. Continually emitted until rotation gesture is
ended. The `rotation` value on each emission is the angle in degrees rotated since
the last emission. The last emitted event upon a rotation gesture will always be of
value `0`. Counter-clockwise rotation values are positive, while clockwise ones are
negative.

#### Event: 'sheet-begin' _macOS_

Emitted when the window opens a sheet.

#### Event: 'sheet-end' _macOS_

Emitted when the window has closed a sheet.

#### Event: 'new-window-for-tab' _macOS_

Emitted when the native new tab button is clicked.

#### Event: 'system-context-menu' _Windows_

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `point` [Point](structures/point.md) - The screen coordinates the context menu was triggered at

Emitted when the system context menu is triggered on the window, this is
normally only triggered when the user right clicks on the non-client area
of your window.  This is the window titlebar or any area you have declared
as `-webkit-app-region: drag` in a frameless window.

Calling `event.preventDefault()` will prevent the menu from being displayed.

### Static Methods

The `BaseWindow` class has the following static methods:

#### `BaseWindow.getAllWindows()`

Returns `BaseWindow[]` - An array of all opened browser windows.

#### `BaseWindow.getFocusedWindow()`

Returns `BaseWindow | null` - The window that is focused in this application, otherwise returns `null`.

#### `BaseWindow.fromId(id)`

* `id` Integer

Returns `BaseWindow | null` - The window with the given `id`.

### Instance Properties

Objects created with `new BaseWindow` have the following properties:

```js
const { BaseWindow } = require('electron')
// In this example `win` is our instance
const win = new BaseWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 })

#### `win.kiosk`

A `boolean` property that determines whether the window is in kiosk mode.

#### `win.documentEdited` _macOS_

A `boolean` property that specifies whether the window’s document has been edited.

The icon in title bar will become gray when set to `true`.

A `string` property that determines the pathname of the file the window represents,
and the icon of the file will show in window's title bar.

#### `win.title`

A `string` property that determines the title of the native window.

**Note:** The title of the web page can be different from the title of the native window.

#### `win.minimizable` _macOS_ _Windows_

A `boolean` property that determines whether the window can be manually minimized by user.

On Linux the setter is a no-op, although the getter returns `true`.

#### `win.maximizable` _macOS_ _Windows_

A `boolean` property that determines whether the window can be manually maximized by user.

On Linux the setter is a no-op, although the getter returns `true`.

#### `win.fullScreenable`

A `boolean` property that determines whether the maximize/zoom window button toggles fullscreen mode or
maximizes the window.

#### `win.resizable`

A `boolean` property that determines whether the window can be manually resized by user.

#### `win.closable` _macOS_ _Windows_

A `boolean` property that determines whether the window can be manually closed by user.

On Linux the setter is a no-op, although the getter returns `true`.

#### `win.movable` _macOS_ _Windows_

```js @ts-expect-error=[12]
const { Menu, BaseWindow } = require('electron')
const win = new BaseWindow({ height: 600, width: 600 })

const template = [
  {
    role: 'windowmenu'
  }
]

win.excludedFromShownWindowsMenu = true

const menu = Menu.buildFromTemplate(template)
Menu.setApplicationMenu(menu)
```

#### `win.accessibleTitle`

A `string` property that defines an alternative title provided only to
accessibility tools such as screen readers. This string is not directly
visible to users.

#### `win.snapped` _Windows_ _Readonly_

A `boolean` property that indicates whether the window is arranged via [Snap.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/snap-your-windows-885a9b1e-a983-a3b1-16cd-c531795e6241)

### Instance Methods

Objects created with `new BaseWindow` have the following instance methods:

**Note:** Some methods are only available on specific operating systems and are
labeled as such.

#### `win.setContentView(view)`

* `view` [View](view.md)

Sets the content view of the window.

#### `win.getContentView()`

Returns [`View`](view.md) - The content view of the window.

#### `win.destroy()`

Force closing the window, the `unload` and `beforeunload` event won't be emitted
for the web page, and `close` event will also not be emitted
for this window, but it guarantees the `closed` event will be emitted.

#### `win.close()`

Try to close the window. This has the same effect as a user manually clicking
the close button of the window. The web page may cancel the close though. See
the [close event](#event-close).

#### `win.focus()`

Focuses on the window.

#### `win.blur()`

Removes focus from the window.

#### `win.isFocused()`

Returns `boolean` - Whether the window is focused.

#### `win.isDestroyed()`

Returns `boolean` - Whether the window is destroyed.

#### `win.show()`

Shows and gives focus to the window.

#### `win.showInactive()`

Shows the window but doesn't focus on it.

#### `win.hide()`

Hides the window.

#### `win.isVisible()`

Returns `boolean` - Whether the window is visible to the user in the foreground of the app.

#### `win.isModal()`

Returns `boolean` - Whether current window is a modal window.

#### `win.maximize()`

Maximizes the window. This will also show (but not focus) the window if it
isn't being displayed already.

#### `win.unmaximize()`

Unmaximizes the window.

#### `win.isMaximized()`

Returns `boolean` - Whether the window is maximized.

#### `win.minimize()`

Minimizes the window. On some platforms the minimized window will be shown in
the Dock.

#### `win.restore()`

Restores the window from minimized state to its previous state.

#### `win.isMinimized()`

Returns `boolean` - Whether the window is minimized.

#### `win.setFullScreen(flag)`

* `flag` boolean

Sets whether the window should be in fullscreen mode.

**Note:** On macOS, fullscreen transitions take place asynchronously. If further actions depend on the fullscreen state, use the ['enter-full-screen'](base-window.md#event-enter-full-screen) or ['leave-full-screen'](base-window.md#event-leave-full-screen) events.

#### `win.isFullScreen()`

Returns `boolean` - Whether the window is in fullscreen mode.

#### `win.setSimpleFullScreen(flag)` _macOS_

* `flag` boolean

Enters or leaves simple fullscreen mode.

Simple fullscreen mode emulates the native fullscreen behavior found in versions of macOS prior to Lion (10.7).

#### `win.isSimpleFullScreen()` _macOS_

Returns `boolean` - Whether the window is in simple (pre-Lion) fullscreen mode.

#### `win.isNormal()`

Returns `boolean` - Whether the window is in normal state (not maximized, not minimized, not in fullscreen mode).

#### `win.setAspectRatio(aspectRatio[, extraSize])`

* `aspectRatio` Float - The aspect ratio to maintain for some portion of the
content view.
* `extraSize` [Size](structures/size.md) (optional) _macOS_ - The extra size not to be included while
maintaining the aspect ratio.

This will make a window maintain an aspect ratio. The extra size allows a
developer to have space, specified in pixels, not included within the aspect
ratio calculations. This API already takes into account the difference between a
window's size and its content size.

Consider a normal window with an HD video player and associated controls.
Perhaps there are 15 pixels of controls on the left edge, 25 pixels of controls
on the right edge and 50 pixels of controls below the player. In order to
maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio (standard aspect ratio for HD @1920x1080) within
the player itself we would call this function with arguments of 16/9 and
\{ width: 40, height: 50 \}. The second argument doesn't care where the extra width and height
are within the content view--only that they exist. Sum any extra width and
height areas you have within the overall content view.

The aspect ratio is not respected when window is resized programmatically with
APIs like `win.setSize`.

To reset an aspect ratio, pass 0 as the `aspectRatio` value: `win.setAspectRatio(0)`.

#### `win.setBackgroundColor(backgroundColor)`

* `backgroundColor` string - Color in Hex, RGB, RGBA, HSL, HSLA or named CSS color format. The alpha channel is optional for the hex type.

Examples of valid `backgroundColor` values:

* Hex
  * #fff (shorthand RGB)
  * #ffff (shorthand ARGB)
  * #ffffff (RGB)
  * #ffffffff (ARGB)
* RGB
  * `rgb\(([\d]+),\s*([\d]+),\s*([\d]+)\)`
    * e.g. rgb(255, 255, 255)
* RGBA
  * `rgba\(([\d]+),\s*([\d]+),\s*([\d]+),\s*([\d.]+)\)`
    * e.g. rgba(255, 255, 255, 1.0)
* HSL
  * `hsl\((-?[\d.]+),\s*([\d.]+)%,\s*([\d.]+)%\)`
    * e.g. hsl(200, 20%, 50%)
* HSLA
  * `hsla\((-?[\d.]+),\s*([\d.]+)%,\s*([\d.]+)%,\s*([\d.]+)\)`
    * e.g. hsla(200, 20%, 50%, 0.5)
* Color name
  * Options are listed in [SkParseColor.cpp](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/skia/src/utils/SkParseColor.cpp;l=11-152;drc=eea4bf52cb0d55e2a39c828b017c80a5ee054148)
  * Similar to CSS Color Module Level 3 keywords, but case-sensitive.
    * e.g. `blueviolet` or `red`

Sets the background color of the window. See [Setting `backgroundColor`](browser-window.md#setting-the-backgroundcolor-property).

#### `win.previewFile(path[, displayName])` _macOS_

* `path` string - The absolute path to the file to preview with QuickLook. This
  is important as Quick Look uses the file name and file extension on the path
  to determine the content type of the file to open.
* `displayName` string (optional) - The name of the file to display on the
  Quick Look modal view. This is purely visual and does not affect the content
  type of the file. Defaults to `path`.

Uses [Quick Look][quick-look] to preview a file at a given path.

#### `win.closeFilePreview()` _macOS_

Closes the currently open [Quick Look][quick-look] panel.

#### `win.setBounds(bounds[, animate])`

* `bounds` Partial\<[Rectangle](structures/rectangle.md)\>
* `animate` boolean (optional) _macOS_

Resizes and moves the window to the supplied bounds. Any properties that are not supplied will default to their current values.

```js
const { BaseWindow } = require('electron')
const win = new BaseWindow()

// set all bounds properties
win.setBounds({ x: 440, y: 225, width: 800, height: 600 })

// set a single bounds property
win.setBounds({ width: 100 })

// { x: 440, y: 225, width: 100, height: 600 }
console.log(win.getBounds())
```

**Note:** On macOS, the y-coordinate value cannot be smaller than the [Tray](tray.md) height. The tray height has changed over time and depends on the operating system, but is between 20-40px. Passing a value lower than the tray height will result in a window that is flush to the tray.

#### `win.getBounds()`

Returns [`Rectangle`](structures/rectangle.md) - The `bounds` of the window as `Object`.

**Note:** On macOS, the y-coordinate value returned will be at minimum the [Tray](tray.md) height. For example, calling `win.setBounds({ x: 25, y: 20, width: 800, height: 600 })` with a tray height of 38 means that `win.getBounds()` will return `{ x: 25, y: 38, width: 800, height: 600 }`.

#### `win.getBackgroundColor()`

Returns `string` - Gets the background color of the window in Hex (`#RRGGBB`) format.

See [Setting `backgroundColor`](browser-window.md#setting-the-backgroundcolor-property).

**Note:** The alpha value is _not_ returned alongside the red, green, and blue values.

#### `win.setContentBounds(bounds[, animate])`

* `bounds` [Rectangle](structures/rectangle.md)
* `animate` boolean (optional) _macOS_

Resizes and moves the window's client area (e.g. the web page) to
the supplied bounds.

#### `win.getContentBounds()`

Returns [`Rectangle`](structures/rectangle.md) - The `bounds` of the window's client area as `Object`.

#### `win.getNormalBounds()`

Returns [`Rectangle`](structures/rectangle.md) - Contains the window bounds of the normal state

**Note:** whatever the current state of the window : maximized, minimized or in fullscreen, this function always returns the position and size of the window in normal state. In normal state, getBounds and getNormalBounds returns the same [`Rectangle`](structures/rectangle.md).

#### `win.setEnabled(enable)`

* `enable` boolean

Disable or enable the window.

#### `win.isEnabled()`

Returns `boolean` - whether the window is enabled.

#### `win.setSize(width, height[, animate])`

* `width` Integer
* `height` Integer
* `animate` boolean (optional) _macOS_

Resizes the window to `width` and `height`. If `width` or `height` are below any set minimum size constraints the window will snap to its minimum size.

#### `win.getSize()`

Returns `Integer[]` - Contains the window's width and height.

#### `win.setContentSize(width, height[, animate])`

* `width` Integer
* `height` Integer
* `animate` boolean (optional) _macOS_

Resizes the window's client area (e.g. the web page) to `width` and `height`.

#### `win.getContentSize()`

Returns `Integer[]` - Contains the window's client area's width and height.

#### `win.setMinimumSize(width, height)`

* `width` Integer
* `height` Integer

Sets the minimum size of window to `width` and `height`.

#### `win.getMinimumSize()`

Returns `Integer[]` - Contains the window's minimum width and height.

* `width` Integer
* `height` Integer

Sets the maximum size of window to `width` and `height`.

#### `win.getMaximumSize()`

Returns `Integer[]` - Contains the window's maximum width and height.

#### `win.setResizable(resizable)`

* `resizable` boolean

Sets whether the window can be manually resized by the user.

#### `win.isResizable()`

Returns `boolean` - Whether the window can be manually resized by the user.

#### `win.setMovable(movable)` _macOS_ _Windows_

* `movable` boolean

Sets whether the window can be moved by user. On Linux does nothing.

#### `win.isMovable()` _macOS_ _Windows_

Returns `boolean` - Whether the window can be moved by user.

On Linux always returns `true`.

#### `win.setMinimizable(minimizable)` _macOS_ _Windows_

* `minimizable` boolean

#### `win.isHiddenInMissionControl()` _macOS_

Returns `boolean` - Whether the window will be hidden when the user toggles into mission control.

#### `win.setAlwaysOnTop(flag[, level][, relativeLevel])`

* `flag` boolean
* `level` string (optional) _macOS_ _Windows_ - Values include `normal`,
  `floating`, `torn-off-menu`, `modal-panel`, `main-menu`, `status`,
  `pop-up-menu`, `screen-saver`, and ~~`dock`~~ (Deprecated). The default is
  `floating` when `flag` is true. The `level` is reset to `normal` when the
  flag is false. Note that from `floating` to `status` included, the window is
  placed below the Dock on macOS and below the taskbar on Windows. From
  `pop-up-menu` to a higher it is shown above the Dock on macOS and above the
  taskbar on Windows. See the [macOS docs][window-levels] for more details.
* `relativeLevel` Integer (optional) _macOS_ - The number of layers higher to set
  this window relative to the given `level`. The default is `0`. Note that Apple
  discourages setting levels higher than 1 above `screen-saver`.

Sets whether the window should show always on top of other windows. After
setting this, the window is still a normal window, not a toolbox window which
can not be focused on.

#### `win.isAlwaysOnTop()`

Returns `boolean` - Whether the window is always on top of other windows.

#### `win.moveAbove(mediaSourceId)`

* `mediaSourceId` string - Window id in the format of DesktopCapturerSource's id. For example "window:1869:0".

Moves window above the source window in the sense of z-order. If the
`mediaSourceId` is not of type window or if the window does not exist then
this method throws an error.

#### `win.moveTop()`

Moves window to top(z-order) regardless of focus

#### `win.center()`

Moves window to the center of the screen.

**Note:** The title of the web page can be different from the title of the native
window.

#### `win.setSheetOffset(offsetY[, offsetX])` _macOS_

* `offsetY` Float
* `offsetX` Float (optional)

Changes the attachment point for sheets on macOS. By default, sheets are
attached just below the window frame, but you may want to display them beneath
a HTML-rendered toolbar. For example:

```js
const { BaseWindow } = require('electron')
const win = new BaseWindow()

const toolbarRect = document.getElementById('toolbar').getBoundingClientRect()
win.setSheetOffset(toolbarRect.height)
```

Since Windows 10 users can [use their PC as tablet](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17210/windows-10-use-your-pc-like-a-tablet),
under this mode apps can choose to optimize their UI for tablets, such as
enlarging the titlebar and hiding titlebar buttons.

This API returns whether the window is in tablet mode, and the `resize` event
can be be used to listen to changes to tablet mode.

#### `win.getMediaSourceId()`

Returns `string` - Window id in the format of DesktopCapturerSource's id. For example "window:1324:0".

More precisely the format is `window:id:other_id` where `id` is `HWND` on
Windows, `CGWindowID` (`uint64_t`) on macOS and `Window` (`unsigned long`) on
Linux. `other_id` is used to identify web contents (tabs) so within the same
top level window.

#### `win.getNativeWindowHandle()`

it will assume `{app.name}.desktop`.

On Windows, a mode can be passed. Accepted values are `none`, `normal`,
`indeterminate`, `error`, and `paused`. If you call `setProgressBar` without a
mode set (but with a value within the valid range), `normal` will be assumed.

#### `win.setOverlayIcon(overlay, description)` _Windows_

* `overlay` [NativeImage](native-image.md) | null - the icon to display on the bottom
right corner of the taskbar icon. If this parameter is `null`, the overlay is

Linux, always returns 1.

#### `win.setShape(rects)` _Windows_ _Linux_ _Experimental_

* `rects` [Rectangle[]](structures/rectangle.md) - Sets a shape on the window.
  Passing an empty list reverts the window to being rectangular.

Setting a window shape determines the area within the window where the system
permits drawing and user interaction. Outside of the given region, no pixels
will be drawn and no mouse events will be registered. Mouse events outside of
the region will not be received by that window, but will fall through to
whatever is behind the window.

#### `win.setThumbarButtons(buttons)` _Windows_

* `buttons` [ThumbarButton[]](structures/thumbar-button.md)

Returns `boolean` - Whether the buttons were added successfully

Add a thumbnail toolbar with a specified set of buttons to the thumbnail image
of a window in a taskbar button layout. Returns a `boolean` object indicates
whether the thumbnail has been added successfully.

The number of buttons in thumbnail toolbar should be no greater than 7 due to
the limited room. Once you setup the thumbnail toolbar, the toolbar cannot be
removed due to the platform's limitation. But you can call the API with an empty
array to clean the buttons.

The `buttons` is an array of `Button` objects:

* `Button` Object
  * `icon` [NativeImage](native-image.md) - The icon showing in thumbnail
    toolbar.

  button state is drawn. This value is intended for instances where the button
  is used in a notification.

#### `win.setThumbnailClip(region)` _Windows_

* `region` [Rectangle](structures/rectangle.md) - Region of the window

Sets the region of the window to show as the thumbnail image displayed when

* `visible` boolean
* `options` Object (optional)
  * `visibleOnFullScreen` boolean (optional) _macOS_ - Sets whether
    the window should be visible above fullscreen windows.
  * `skipTransformProcessType` boolean (optional) _macOS_ - Calling
    setVisibleOnAllWorkspaces will by default transform the process
    type between UIElementApplication and ForegroundApplication to
    ensure the correct behavior. However, this will hide the window
    and dock for a short time every time it is called. If your window
    is already of type UIElementApplication, you can bypass this
    transformation by passing true to skipTransformProcessType.

Sets whether the window should be visible on all workspaces.

**Note:** This API does nothing on Windows.

#### `win.isVisibleOnAllWorkspaces()` _macOS_ _Linux_

Returns `boolean` - Whether the window is visible on all workspaces.
