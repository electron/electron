> Register for and receive notifications from remote push notification services

For example, when registering for push notifications via Apple push notification services (APNS):

```javascript
const { pushNotifications, Notification } = require('electron')

pushNotifications.registerForAPNSNotifications().then((token) => {
  // forward token to your remote notification server
})

pushNotifications.on('received-apns-notification', (event, userInfo) => {
  // generate a new Notification object with the relevant userInfo fields
})
```

## Events

The `pushNotification` module emits the following events:

#### Event: 'received-apns-notification' _macOS_

## Methods

The `pushNotification` module has the following methods:

### `pushNotifications.registerForAPNSNotifications()` _macOS_

Returns `Promise<string>`

Registers the app with Apple Push Notification service (APNS) to receive [Badge, Sound, and Alert](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/sremotenotificationtype?language=objc) notifications. If registration is successful, the promise will be resolved with the APNS device token. Otherwise, the promise will be rejected with an error message.
