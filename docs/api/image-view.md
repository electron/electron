# ImageView

> A View that displays an image.

Process: [Main](../glossary.md#main-process)

This module cannot be used until the `ready` event of the `app`
module is emitted.

Useful for showing splash screens that will be swapped for `WebContentsView`s
when the content finishes loading.

Note that `ImageView` is experimental and may be changed or removed in the future.

```js
const { BaseWindow, ImageView, nativeImage, WebContentsView } = require('electron')
const path = require('node:path')

const win = new BaseWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 })

// Create a "splash screen" image to display while the WebContentsView loads
const splashView = new ImageView()
const splashImage = nativeImage.createFromPath(path.join(__dirname, 'loading.png'))
splashView.setImage(splashImage)
win.setContentView(splashView)

const webContentsView = new WebContentsView()
webContentsView.webContents.once('did-finish-load', () => {
  // Now that the WebContentsView has loaded, swap out the "splash screen" ImageView
  win.setContentView(webContentsView)
})
webContentsView.webContents.loadURL('https://electronjs.org')
```
