# LayeredTrayImage Object

* `layers` ([NativeImage](../native-image.md) | string)[] - An array of images that will be composed into a single tray icon. Each image in the array will be drawn on top of the previous one, allowing you to compose template images with non-template images (e.g., colored badges or indicators). The array can contain a mix of `NativeImage` instances and string paths.
