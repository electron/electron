  `error` number . For the available error numbers you can use, please see the

* `charset` string (optional) - The charset of response body, default is
  `"utf-8"`.
* `mimeType` string (optional) - The MIME type of response body, default is
  `"text/html"`. Setting `mimeType` would implicitly set the `content-type`
  header in response, but if `content-type` is already set in `headers`, the
  `mimeType` would be ignored.

  keys must be string, and values must be either string or Array of string.
* `data` (Buffer | string | ReadableStream) (optional) - The response body. When
  returning stream as response, this is a Node.js readable stream representing
  the response body. When returning `Buffer` as response, this is a `Buffer`.
  When returning `string` as response, this is a `string`. This is ignored for
  other types of responses.

  body. This is only used for file responses.

  used for URL responses when `method` is `"POST"`.
