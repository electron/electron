# webContents

> Render and control web pages.

Process: [Main](../glossary.md#main-process)

`webContents` is an [EventEmitter][event-emitter].
It is responsible for rendering and controlling a web page and is a property of
the [`BrowserWindow`](browser-window.md) object. An example of accessing the
`webContents` object:

```js
const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

const win = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 1500 })
win.loadURL('https://github.com')

const contents = win.webContents
console.log(contents)
```

## Navigation Events

Several events can be used to monitor navigations as they occur within a `webContents`.

### Document Navigations

When a `webContents` navigates to another page (as opposed to an [in-page navigation](web-contents.md#in-page-navigation)), the following events will be fired.

* [`did-start-navigation`](web-contents.md#event-did-start-navigation)
* [`will-frame-navigate`](web-contents.md#event-will-frame-navigate)
* [`will-navigate`](web-contents.md#event-will-navigate) (only fired when main frame navigates)
* [`will-redirect`](web-contents.md#event-will-redirect) (only fired when a redirect happens during navigation)
* [`did-redirect-navigation`](web-contents.md#event-did-redirect-navigation) (only fired when a redirect happens during navigation)
* [`did-frame-navigate`](web-contents.md#event-did-frame-navigate)
* [`did-navigate`](web-contents.md#event-did-navigate) (only fired when main frame navigates)

Subsequent events will not fire if `event.preventDefault()` is called on any of the cancellable events.

### In-page Navigation

In-page navigations don't cause the page to reload, but instead navigate to a location within the current page. These events are not cancellable. For an in-page navigations, the following events will fire in this order:

* [`did-start-navigation`](web-contents.md#event-did-start-navigation)
* [`did-navigate-in-page`](web-contents.md#event-did-navigate-in-page)

### Frame Navigation

The [`will-navigate`](web-contents.md#event-will-navigate) and [`did-navigate`](web-contents.md#event-did-navigate) events only fire when the [mainFrame](web-contents.md#contentsmainframe-readonly) navigates.
If you want to also observe navigations in `<iframe>`s, use [`will-frame-navigate`](web-contents.md#event-will-frame-navigate) and [`did-frame-navigate`](web-contents.md#event-did-frame-navigate) events.

## Methods

These methods can be accessed from the `webContents` module:

```js
const { webContents } = require('electron')
console.log(webContents)
```

### `webContents.getAllWebContents()`

Returns `WebContents[]` - An array of all `WebContents` instances. This will contain web contents
for all windows, webviews, opened devtools, and devtools extension background pages.

### `webContents.getFocusedWebContents()`

Returns `WebContents | null` - The web contents that is focused in this application, otherwise
returns `null`.

### `webContents.fromId(id)`

* `id` Integer

Returns `WebContents | undefined` - A WebContents instance with the given ID, or
`undefined` if there is no WebContents associated with the given ID.

### `webContents.fromFrame(frame)`

* `frame` WebFrameMain

Returns `WebContents | undefined` - A WebContents instance with the given WebFrameMain, or
`undefined` if there is no WebContents associated with the given WebFrameMain.

### `webContents.fromDevToolsTargetId(targetId)`

* `targetId` string - The Chrome DevTools Protocol [TargetID](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Target/#type-TargetID) associated with the WebContents instance.

Returns `WebContents | undefined` - A WebContents instance with the given TargetID, or
`undefined` if there is no WebContents associated with the given TargetID.

When communicating with the [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/),
it can be useful to lookup a WebContents instance based on its assigned TargetID.

```js
async function lookupTargetId (browserWindow) {
  const wc = browserWindow.webContents
  await wc.debugger.attach('1.3')
  const { targetInfo } = await wc.debugger.sendCommand('Target.getTargetInfo')
  const { targetId } = targetInfo
  const targetWebContents = await wc.fromDevToolsTargetId(targetId)
}
```

## Class: WebContents

> Render and control the contents of a BrowserWindow instance.

Process: [Main](../glossary.md#main-process)<br />
_This class is not exported from the `'electron'` module. It is only available as a return value of other methods in the Electron API._

#### Event: 'will-navigate'

Returns:

* `details` Event\<\>
  * `url` string - The URL the frame is navigating to.
  * `isSameDocument` boolean - This event does not fire for same document navigations using window.history api and reference fragment navigations.
    This property is always set to `false` for this event.
  * `isMainFrame` boolean - True if the navigation is taking place in a main frame.
  * `frame` WebFrameMain - The frame to be navigated.
  * `initiator` WebFrameMain (optional) - The frame which initiated the
    navigation, which can be a parent frame (e.g. via `window.open` with a

    emitted.
* `url` string _Deprecated_
* `isInPlace` boolean _Deprecated_
* `isMainFrame` boolean _Deprecated_
* `frameProcessId` Integer _Deprecated_
* `frameRoutingId` Integer _Deprecated_

Emitted when a user or the page wants to start navigation on the main frame. It can happen when
the `window.location` object is changed or a user clicks a link in the page.

This event will not emit when the navigation is started programmatically with
APIs like `webContents.loadURL` and `webContents.back`.

It is also not emitted for in-page navigations, such as clicking anchor links
or updating the `window.location.hash`. Use `did-navigate-in-page` event for
this purpose.

Calling `event.preventDefault()` will prevent the navigation.

#### Event: 'will-frame-navigate'

Returns:

* `details` Event\<\>
  * `url` string - The URL the frame is navigating to.
  * `isSameDocument` boolean - This event does not fire for same document navigations using window.history api and reference fragment navigations.
    This property is always set to `false` for this event.
  * `isMainFrame` boolean - True if the navigation is taking place in a main frame.
  * `frame` WebFrameMain - The frame to be navigated.
  * `initiator` WebFrameMain (optional) - The frame which initiated the
    navigation, which can be a parent frame (e.g. via `window.open` with a
    frame's name), or null if the navigation was not initiated by a frame. This
    can also be null if the initiating frame was deleted before the event was
    emitted.

Emitted when a user or the page wants to start navigation in any frame. It can happen when
the `window.location` object is changed or a user clicks a link in the page.

Unlike `will-navigate`, `will-frame-navigate` is fired when the main frame or any of its subframes attempts to navigate. When the navigation event comes from the main frame, `isMainFrame` will be `true`.

This event will not emit when the navigation is started programmatically with
APIs like `webContents.loadURL` and `webContents.back`.

It is also not emitted for in-page navigations, such as clicking anchor links
or updating the `window.location.hash`. Use `did-navigate-in-page` event for
this purpose.

Calling `event.preventDefault()` will prevent the navigation.

#### Event: 'did-start-navigation'

Returns:

* `details` Event\<\>
  * `url` string - The URL the frame is navigating to.

    document. Examples of same document navigations are reference fragment
    navigations, pushState/replaceState, and same page history navigation.
  * `isMainFrame` boolean - True if the navigation is taking place in a main frame.
  * `frame` WebFrameMain - The frame to be navigated.
  * `initiator` WebFrameMain (optional) - The frame which initiated the
    navigation, which can be a parent frame (e.g. via `window.open` with a
    frame's name), or null if the navigation was not initiated by a frame. This
    can also be null if the initiating frame was deleted before the event was

redirect).

#### Event: 'did-redirect-navigation'

Returns:

* `details` Event\<\>
  * `url` string - The URL the frame is navigating to.
  * `isSameDocument` boolean - Whether the navigation happened without changing
    document. Examples of same document navigations are reference fragment
    navigations, pushState/replaceState, and same page history navigation.
  * `isMainFrame` boolean - True if the navigation is taking place in a main frame.
  * `frame` WebFrameMain - The frame to be navigated.
  * `initiator` WebFrameMain (optional) - The frame which initiated the
    navigation, which can be a parent frame (e.g. via `window.open` with a

checkout out the `will-redirect` event above.

#### Event: 'did-navigate'

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `url` string
* `httpResponseCode` Integer - -1 for non HTTP navigations
* `httpStatusText` string - empty for non HTTP navigations

Emitted when a main frame navigation is done.

this purpose.

#### Event: 'did-frame-navigate'

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `url` string
* `httpResponseCode` Integer - -1 for non HTTP navigations
* `httpStatusText` string - empty for non HTTP navigations,

this purpose.

#### Event: 'did-navigate-in-page'

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `url` string
* `isMainFrame` boolean
* `frameProcessId` Integer
* `frameRoutingId` Integer

Emitted when an in-page navigation happened in any frame.

When in-page navigation happens, the page URL changes but does not cause
navigation outside of the page. Examples of this occurring are when anchor links
are clicked or when the DOM `hashchange` event is triggered.

#### Event: 'will-prevent-unload'

Returns:

* `event` Event

Emitted when a `beforeunload` event handler is attempting to cancel a page unload.

Calling `event.preventDefault()` will ignore the `beforeunload` event handler
and allow the page to be unloaded.

```js
const { BrowserWindow, dialog } = require('electron')
const win = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 })
win.webContents.on('will-prevent-unload', (event) => {
  const choice = dialog.showMessageBoxSync(win, {
    type: 'question',
    buttons: ['Leave', 'Stay'],
    title: 'Do you want to leave this site?',
    message: 'Changes you made may not be saved.',
    defaultId: 0,
    cancelId: 1
  })
  const leave = (choice === 0)
  if (leave) {
    event.preventDefault()
  }
})
```

**Note:** This will be emitted for `BrowserViews` but will _not_ be respected - this is because we have chosen not to tie the `BrowserView` lifecycle to its owning BrowserWindow should one exist per the [specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/beforeunload_event).

#### Event: 'render-process-gone'

Returns:

[InputEvent](structures/input-event.md) for details.

#### Event: 'before-input-event'

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `input` Object - Input properties.
  * `type` string - Either `keyUp` or `keyDown`.
  * `key` string - Equivalent to [KeyboardEvent.key][keyboardevent].
  * `code` string - Equivalent to [KeyboardEvent.code][keyboardevent].

Emitted before dispatching the `keydown` and `keyup` events in the page.
Calling `event.preventDefault` will prevent the page `keydown`/`keyup` events
and the menu shortcuts.

To only prevent the menu shortcuts, use
[`setIgnoreMenuShortcuts`](#contentssetignoremenushortcutsignore):

```js
const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

const win = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 })

win.webContents.on('before-input-event', (event, input) => {
  // For example, only enable application menu keyboard shortcuts when
  // Ctrl/Cmd are down.
  win.webContents.setIgnoreMenuShortcuts(!input.control && !input.meta)
})
```

#### Event: 'enter-html-full-screen'

#### Event: 'blur'

Emitted when the `WebContents` loses focus.

#### Event: 'focus'

Emitted when the `WebContents` gains focus.

Note that on macOS, having focus means the `WebContents` is the first responder
of window, so switching focus between windows would not trigger the `focus` and
`blur` events of `WebContents`, as the first responder of each window is not
changed.

The `focus` and `blur` events of `WebContents` should only be used to detect
focus change between different `WebContents` and `BrowserView` in the same
window.

#### Event: 'select-bluetooth-device'

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `devices` [BluetoothDevice[]](structures/bluetooth-device.md)
* `callback` Function
  * `deviceId` string

Emitted when a bluetooth device needs to be selected when a call to
`navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice` is made. `callback` should be called with
the `deviceId` of the device to be selected.  Passing an empty string to
`callback` will cancel the request.

If an event listener is not added for this event, or if `event.preventDefault`
is not called when handling this event, the first available device will be
automatically selected.

Due to the nature of bluetooth, scanning for devices when
`navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice` is called may take time and will cause
`select-bluetooth-device` to fire multiple times until `callback` is called
with either a device id or an empty string to cancel the request.

```js title='main.js'
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

let win = null

app.whenReady().then(() => {
  win = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 })
  win.webContents.on('select-bluetooth-device', (event, deviceList, callback) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    const result = deviceList.find((device) => {
      return device.deviceName === 'test'
    })
    if (!result) {
      // The device wasn't found so we need to either wait longer (eg until the
      // device is turned on) or cancel the request by calling the callback
      // with an empty string.
      callback('')
    } else {
      callback(result.deviceId)
    }
  })
})
```

#### Event: 'paint'

Returns:

* `details` Event\<\>
  * `texture` [OffscreenSharedTexture](structures/offscreen-shared-texture.md) (optional) _Experimental_ - The GPU shared texture of the frame, when `webPreferences.offscreen.useSharedTexture` is `true`.
* `dirtyRect` [Rectangle](structures/rectangle.md)
* `image` [NativeImage](native-image.md) - The image data of the whole frame.

Emitted when a new frame is generated. Only the dirty area is passed in the buffer.

```js
const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

const win = new BrowserWindow({ webPreferences: { offscreen: true } })
win.webContents.on('paint', (event, dirty, image) => {
  // updateBitmap(dirty, image.getBitmap())
})
win.loadURL('https://github.com')
```

When using shared texture (set `webPreferences.offscreen.useSharedTexture` to `true`) feature, you can pass the texture handle to external rendering pipeline without the overhead of
copying data between CPU and GPU memory, with Chromium's hardware acceleration support. This feature is helpful for high-performance rendering scenarios.

Only a limited number of textures can exist at the same time, so it's important that you call `texture.release()` as soon as you're done with the texture.
By managing the texture lifecycle by yourself, you can safely pass the `texture.textureInfo` to other processes through IPC.

```js
const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

const win = new BrowserWindow({ webPreferences: { offscreen: { useSharedTexture: true } } })
win.webContents.on('paint', async (e, dirty, image) => {
  if (e.texture) {
    // By managing lifecycle yourself, you can handle the event in async handler or pass the `e.texture.textureInfo`
    // to other processes (not `e.texture`, the `e.texture.release` function is not passable through IPC).
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50))

    // You can send the native texture handle to native code for importing into your rendering pipeline.
    // For example: https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/main/spec/fixtures/native-addon/osr-gpu
    // importTextureHandle(dirty, e.texture.textureInfo)

    // You must call `e.texture.release()` as soon as possible, before the underlying frame pool is drained.
    e.texture.release()
  }
})
win.loadURL('https://github.com')
```

### Instance Methods

#### `contents.loadURL(url[, options])`

* `url` string
* `options` Object (optional)
  * `httpReferrer` (string | [Referrer](structures/referrer.md)) (optional) - An HTTP Referrer url.
  * `userAgent` string (optional) - A user agent originating the request.
  * `extraHeaders` string (optional) - Extra headers separated by "\n".
  * `postData` ([UploadRawData](structures/upload-raw-data.md) | [UploadFile](structures/upload-file.md))[] (optional)
  * `baseURLForDataURL` string (optional) - Base url (with trailing path separator) for files to be loaded by the data url. This is needed only if the specified `url` is a data url and needs to load other files.

Returns `Promise<void>` - the promise will resolve when the page has finished loading
(see [`did-finish-load`](web-contents.md#event-did-finish-load)), and rejects
if the page fails to load (see
[`did-fail-load`](web-contents.md#event-did-fail-load)). A noop rejection handler is already attached, which avoids unhandled rejection errors.

Loads the `url` in the window. The `url` must contain the protocol prefix,
e.g. the `http://` or `file://`. If the load should bypass http cache then
use the `pragma` header to achieve it.

```js
const win = new BrowserWindow()
const options = { extraHeaders: 'pragma: no-cache\n' }
win.webContents.loadURL('https://github.com', options)
```

#### `contents.loadFile(filePath[, options])`

* `filePath` string
* `options` Object (optional)
  * `query` Record\<string, string\> (optional) - Passed to `url.format()`.
  * `search` string (optional) - Passed to `url.format()`.
  * `hash` string (optional) - Passed to `url.format()`.

Returns `Promise<void>` - the promise will resolve when the page has finished loading
(see [`did-finish-load`](web-contents.md#event-did-finish-load)), and rejects
if the page fails to load (see [`did-fail-load`](web-contents.md#event-did-fail-load)).

Loads the given file in the window, `filePath` should be a path to
an HTML file relative to the root of your application.  For instance
an app structure like this:

```sh
| root
| - package.json
| - src
|   - main.js
|   - index.html
```

Would require code like this

```js
const win = new BrowserWindow()
win.loadFile('src/index.html')
```

#### `contents.downloadURL(url[, options])`

* `url` string
* `options` Object (optional)
  * `headers` Record\<string, string\> (optional) - HTTP request headers.

Initiates a download of the resource at `url` without navigating. The
`will-download` event of `session` will be triggered.

#### `contents.getURL()`

Returns `string` - The URL of the current web page.

```js
const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')
const win = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 })
win.loadURL('https://github.com').then(() => {
  const currentURL = win.webContents.getURL()
  console.log(currentURL)
})
```

#### `contents.getTitle()`

    will not be closed. The [`will-prevent-unload`](#event-will-prevent-unload)
    will be fired if the page requests prevention of unload.

Closes the page, as if the web content had called `window.close()`.

If the page is successfully closed (i.e. the unload is not prevented by the
page, or `waitForBeforeUnload` is false or unspecified), the WebContents will
be destroyed and no longer usable. The [`destroyed`](#event-destroyed) event
will be emitted.

#### `contents.focus()`

Focuses the web page.

#### `contents.isFocused()`

Returns `boolean` - Whether the web page is focused.

#### `contents.isLoading()`

Returns `boolean` - Whether web page is still loading resources.

#### `contents.isLoadingMainFrame()`

Returns `boolean` - Whether the main frame (and not just iframes or frames within it) is
still loading.

#### `contents.isCrashed()`

Returns `boolean` - Whether the renderer process has crashed.

#### `contents.forcefullyCrashRenderer()`

Forcefully terminates the renderer process that is currently hosting this
`webContents`. This will cause the `render-process-gone` event to be emitted
with the `reason=killed || reason=crashed`. Please note that some webContents share renderer
processes and therefore calling this method may also crash the host process
for other webContents as well.

Calling `reload()` immediately after calling this
method will force the reload to occur in a new process. This should be used
when this process is unstable or unusable, for instance in order to recover
from the `unresponsive` event.

```js
const win = new BrowserWindow()

win.webContents.on('unresponsive', async () => {
  const { response } = await dialog.showMessageBox({
    message: 'App X has become unresponsive',
    title: 'Do you want to try forcefully reloading the app?',
    buttons: ['OK', 'Cancel'],
    cancelId: 1
  })
  if (response === 0) {
    win.webContents.forcefullyCrashRenderer()
    win.webContents.reload()
  }
})
```

#### `contents.setUserAgent(userAgent)`

  * `cssOrigin` string (optional) - Can be 'user' or 'author'. Sets the [cascade origin](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-cascade/#cascade-origin) of the inserted stylesheet. Default is 'author'.

Returns `Promise<string>` - A promise that resolves with a key for the inserted CSS that can later be used to remove the CSS via `contents.removeInsertedCSS(key)`.

Injects CSS into the current web page and returns a unique key for the inserted
stylesheet.

```js
const win = new BrowserWindow()
win.webContents.on('did-finish-load', () => {
  win.webContents.insertCSS('html, body { background-color: #f00; }')
})
```

#### `contents.removeInsertedCSS(key)`

* `key` string

Returns `Promise<void>` - Resolves if the removal was successful.

Removes the inserted CSS from the current web page. The stylesheet is identified
by its key, which is returned from `contents.insertCSS(css)`.

```js
const win = new BrowserWindow()

win.webContents.on('did-finish-load', async () => {
  const key = await win.webContents.insertCSS('html, body { background-color: #f00; }')
  win.webContents.removeInsertedCSS(key)
})
```

#### `contents.executeJavaScript(code[, userGesture])`

* `code` string
* `userGesture` boolean (optional) - Default is `false`.

Returns `Promise<any>` - A promise that resolves with the result of the executed code
or is rejected if the result of the code is a rejected promise.

Evaluates `code` in page.

In the browser window some HTML APIs like `requestFullScreen` can only be
invoked by a gesture from the user. Setting `userGesture` to `true` will remove
this limitation.

Code execution will be suspended until web page stop loading.

```js
const win = new BrowserWindow()

win.webContents.executeJavaScript('fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1").then(resp => resp.json())', true)
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result) // Will be the JSON object from the fetch call
  })
```

#### `contents.executeJavaScriptInIsolatedWorld(worldId, scripts[, userGesture])`

* `worldId` Integer - The ID of the world to run the javascript in, `0` is the default world, `999` is the world used by Electron's `contextIsolation` feature.  You can provide any integer here.
* `scripts` [WebSource[]](structures/web-source.md)
* `userGesture` boolean (optional) - Default is `false`.

Returns `Promise<any>` - A promise that resolves with the result of the executed code
or is rejected if the result of the code is a rejected promise.

Works like `executeJavaScript` but evaluates `scripts` in an isolated context.

#### `contents.setIgnoreMenuShortcuts(ignore)`

* `ignore` boolean

Ignore application menu shortcuts while this web contents is focused.

#### `contents.setWindowOpenHandler(handler)`

* `handler` Function\<[WindowOpenHandlerResponse](structures/window-open-handler-response.md)\>
  * `details` Object
    * `url` string - The _resolved_ version of the URL passed to `window.open()`. e.g. opening a window with `window.open('foo')` will yield something like `https://the-origin/the/current/path/foo`.
    * `frameName` string - Name of the window provided in `window.open()`
    * `features` string - Comma separated list of window features provided to `window.open()`.
    * `disposition` string - Can be `default`, `foreground-tab`, `background-tab`,
      `new-window` or `other`.
    * `referrer` [Referrer](structures/referrer.md) - The referrer that will be
      passed to the new window. May or may not result in the `Referer` header being
      sent, depending on the referrer policy.
    * `postBody` [PostBody](structures/post-body.md) (optional) - The post data that
      will be sent to the new window, along with the appropriate headers that will
      be set. If no post data is to be sent, the value will be `null`. Only defined
      when the window is being created by a form that set `target=_blank`.

  Returns `WindowOpenHandlerResponse` - When set to `{ action: 'deny' }` cancels the creation of the new
  window. `{ action: 'allow' }` will allow the new window to be created.
  Returning an unrecognized value such as a null, undefined, or an object
  without a recognized 'action' value will result in a console error and have
  the same effect as returning `{action: 'deny'}`.

Called before creating a window a new window is requested by the renderer, e.g.
by `window.open()`, a link with `target="_blank"`, shift+clicking on a link, or
submitting a form with `<form target="_blank">`. See
[`window.open()`](window-open.md) for more details and how to use this in
conjunction with `did-create-window`.

An example showing how to customize the process of new `BrowserWindow` creation to be `BrowserView` attached to main window instead:

```js
const { BrowserView, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow()

mainWindow.webContents.setWindowOpenHandler((details) => {
  return {
    action: 'allow',
    createWindow: (options) => {
      const browserView = new BrowserView(options)
      mainWindow.addBrowserView(browserView)
      browserView.setBounds({ x: 0, y: 0, width: 640, height: 480 })
      return browserView.webContents
    }
  }
})
```

#### `contents.setAudioMuted(muted)`

#### `contents.isAudioMuted()`

Returns `boolean` - Whether this page has been muted.

#### `contents.isCurrentlyAudible()`

Returns `boolean` - Whether audio is currently playing.

#### `contents.setZoomFactor(factor)`

* `factor` Double - Zoom factor; default is 1.0.

Changes the zoom factor to the specified factor. Zoom factor is
zoom percent divided by 100, so 300% = 3.0.

The factor must be greater than 0.0.

#### `contents.getZoomFactor()`

Returns `number` - the current zoom factor.

#### `contents.setZoomLevel(level)`

* `level` number - Zoom level.

Changes the zoom level to the specified level. The original size is 0 and each
increment above or below represents zooming 20% larger or smaller to default
limits of 300% and 50% of original size, respectively. The formula for this is
`scale := 1.2 ^ level`.

> **NOTE**: The zoom policy at the Chromium level is same-origin, meaning that the
> zoom level for a specific domain propagates across all instances of windows with
> the same domain. Differentiating the window URLs will make zoom work per-window.

#### `contents.getZoomLevel()`

Returns `number` - the current zoom level.

#### `contents.setVisualZoomLevelLimits(minimumLevel, maximumLevel)`

* `minimumLevel` number
* `maximumLevel` number

Returns `Promise<void>`

Sets the maximum and minimum pinch-to-zoom level.

> **NOTE**: Visual zoom is disabled by default in Electron. To re-enable it, call:

Adjusts the current text selection starting and ending points in the focused frame by the given amounts. A negative amount moves the selection towards the beginning of the document, and a positive amount moves the selection towards the end of the document.

Example:

```js
const win = new BrowserWindow()

// Adjusts the beginning of the selection 1 letter forward,
// and the end of the selection 5 letters forward.
win.webContents.adjustSelection({ start: 1, end: 5 })

// Adjusts the beginning of the selection 2 letters forward,
// and the end of the selection 3 letters backward.
win.webContents.adjustSelection({ start: 2, end: -3 })
```

For a call of `win.webContents.adjustSelection({ start: 1, end: 5 })`

Before:

#### `contents.addWorkSpace(path)`

* `path` string

Adds the specified path to DevTools workspace. Must be used after DevTools
creation:

```js
const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')
const win = new BrowserWindow()
win.webContents.on('devtools-opened', () => {
  win.webContents.addWorkSpace(__dirname)
})
```

#### `contents.removeWorkSpace(path)`

* `path` string

Removes the specified path from DevTools workspace.

#### `contents.setDevToolsWebContents(devToolsWebContents)`

* `devToolsWebContents` WebContents

Uses the `devToolsWebContents` as the target `WebContents` to show devtools.

The `devToolsWebContents` must not have done any navigation, and it should not
be used for other purposes after the call.

By default Electron manages the devtools by creating an internal `WebContents`
with native view, which developers have very limited control of. With the
`setDevToolsWebContents` method, developers can use any `WebContents` to show
the devtools in it, including `BrowserWindow`, `BrowserView` and `<webview>`
tag.

Note that closing the devtools does not destroy the `devToolsWebContents`, it
is caller's responsibility to destroy `devToolsWebContents`.

An example of showing devtools in a `<webview>` tag:

```html
<html>
<head>
  <style type="text/css">
    * { margin: 0; }
    #browser { height: 70%; }
    #devtools { height: 30%; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <webview id="browser" src="https://github.com"></webview>
  <webview id="devtools" src="about:blank"></webview>
  <script>
    const { ipcRenderer } = require('electron')
    const emittedOnce = (element, eventName) => new Promise(resolve => {
      element.addEventListener(eventName, event => resolve(event), { once: true })
    })
    const browserView = document.getElementById('browser')
    const devtoolsView = document.getElementById('devtools')
    const browserReady = emittedOnce(browserView, 'dom-ready')
    const devtoolsReady = emittedOnce(devtoolsView, 'dom-ready')
    Promise.all([browserReady, devtoolsReady]).then(() => {
      const targetId = browserView.getWebContentsId()
      const devtoolsId = devtoolsView.getWebContentsId()
      ipcRenderer.send('open-devtools', targetId, devtoolsId)
    })
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

```js
// Main process
const { ipcMain, webContents } = require('electron')
ipcMain.on('open-devtools', (event, targetContentsId, devtoolsContentsId) => {
  const target = webContents.fromId(targetContentsId)
  const devtools = webContents.fromId(devtoolsContentsId)
  target.setDevToolsWebContents(devtools)
  target.openDevTools()
})
```

An example of showing devtools in a `BrowserWindow`:

```js title='main.js'
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

let win = null
let devtools = null

app.whenReady().then(() => {
  win = new BrowserWindow()
  devtools = new BrowserWindow()
  win.loadURL('https://github.com')
  win.webContents.setDevToolsWebContents(devtools.webContents)
  win.webContents.openDevTools({ mode: 'detach' })
})
```

#### `contents.openDevTools([options])`

* `options` Object (optional)
  * `mode` string - Opens the devtools with specified dock state, can be
    `left`, `right`, `bottom`, `undocked`, `detach`. Defaults to last used dock state.
    In `undocked` mode it's possible to dock back. In `detach` mode it's not.
  * `activate` boolean (optional) - Whether to bring the opened devtools window
    to the foreground. The default is `true`.
  * `title` string (optional) - A title for the DevTools window (only in `undocked` or `detach` mode).

Opens the devtools.

When `contents` is a `<webview>` tag, the `mode` would be `detach` by default,
explicitly passing an empty `mode` can force using last used dock state.

On Windows, if Windows Control Overlay is enabled, Devtools will be opened with `mode: 'detach'`.

#### `contents.closeDevTools()`

Closes the devtools.

#### `contents.isDevToolsOpened()`

Returns `boolean` - Whether the devtools is opened.

#### `contents.isDevToolsFocused()`

Returns `boolean` - Whether the devtools view is focused .

#### `contents.getDevToolsTitle()`

Returns `string` - the current title of the DevTools window. This will only be visible
if DevTools is opened in `undocked` or `detach` mode.

#### `contents.setDevToolsTitle(title)`

* `title` string

Changes the title of the DevTools window to `title`. This will only be visible if DevTools is
opened in `undocked` or `detach` mode.

#### `contents.toggleDevTools()`

Toggles the developer tools.

#### `contents.inspectElement(x, y)`

* `x` Integer
* `y` Integer

Starts inspecting element at position (`x`, `y`).

#### `contents.inspectSharedWorker()`

Opens the developer tools for the shared worker context.

#### `contents.inspectSharedWorkerById(workerId)`

* `workerId` string

Inspects the shared worker based on its ID.

#### `contents.getAllSharedWorkers()`

Returns [`SharedWorkerInfo[]`](structures/shared-worker-info.md) - Information about all Shared Workers.

#### `contents.inspectServiceWorker()`

Opens the developer tools for the service worker context.

#### `contents.send(channel, ...args)`

* `channel` string
* `...args` any[]

Send an asynchronous message to the renderer process via `channel`, along with
arguments. Arguments will be serialized with the [Structured Clone Algorithm][SCA],
just like [`postMessage`][], so prototype chains will not be
included. Sending Functions, Promises, Symbols, WeakMaps, or WeakSets will
throw an exception.

:::warning

Sending non-standard JavaScript types such as DOM objects or
special Electron objects will throw an exception.

:::

For additional reading, refer to [Electron's IPC guide](../tutorial/ipc.md).

#### `contents.sendToFrame(frameId, channel, ...args)`

* `frameId` Integer | \[number, number] - the ID of the frame to send to, or a
  pair of `[processId, frameId]` if the frame is in a different process to the
  main frame.
* `channel` string
* `...args` any[]

Send an asynchronous message to a specific frame in a renderer process via
`channel`, along with arguments. Arguments will be serialized with the
[Structured Clone Algorithm][SCA], just like [`postMessage`][], so prototype
chains will not be included. Sending Functions, Promises, Symbols, WeakMaps, or
WeakSets will throw an exception.

> **NOTE:** Sending non-standard JavaScript types such as DOM objects or
> special Electron objects will throw an exception.

The renderer process can handle the message by listening to `channel` with the
[`ipcRenderer`](ipc-renderer.md) module.

If you want to get the `frameId` of a given renderer context you should use
the `webFrame.routingId` value.  E.g.

```js
// In a renderer process
console.log('My frameId is:', require('electron').webFrame.routingId)
```

You can also read `frameId` from all incoming IPC messages in the main process.

```js
// In the main process
ipcMain.on('ping', (event) => {
  console.info('Message came from frameId:', event.frameId)
})
```

#### `contents.postMessage(channel, message, [transfer])`

* `channel` string
* `message` any
* `transfer` MessagePortMain[] (optional)

Send a message to the renderer process, optionally transferring ownership of
zero or more [`MessagePortMain`][] objects.

The transferred `MessagePortMain` objects will be available in the renderer
process by accessing the `ports` property of the emitted event. When they
arrive in the renderer, they will be native DOM `MessagePort` objects.

For example:

```js
// Main process
const win = new BrowserWindow()
const { port1, port2 } = new MessageChannelMain()
win.webContents.postMessage('port', { message: 'hello' }, [port1])

// Renderer process
ipcRenderer.on('port', (e, msg) => {
  const [port] = e.ports
  // ...
})
```

  * `deviceScaleFactor` Integer - Set the device scale factor (if zero defaults to
      original device scale factor) (default: `0`).
  * `viewSize` [Size](structures/size.md) - Set the emulated view size (empty means no override)
  * `scale` Float - Scale of emulated view inside available space (not in fit to
      view mode) (default: `1`).

Enable device emulation with the given parameters.

#### `contents.disableDeviceEmulation()`

Disable device emulation enabled by `webContents.enableDeviceEmulation`.

#### `contents.sendInputEvent(inputEvent)`

* `inputEvent` [MouseInputEvent](structures/mouse-input-event.md) | [MouseWheelInputEvent](structures/mouse-wheel-input-event.md) | [KeyboardInputEvent](structures/keyboard-input-event.md)

Sends an input `event` to the page.
**Note:** The [`BrowserWindow`](browser-window.md) containing the contents needs to be focused for
`sendInputEvent()` to work.

#### `contents.beginFrameSubscription([onlyDirty ,]callback)`

* `onlyDirty` boolean (optional) - Defaults to `false`.
* `callback` Function
  * `image` [NativeImage](native-image.md)
  * `dirtyRect` [Rectangle](structures/rectangle.md)

Begin subscribing for presentation events and captured frames, the `callback`
will be called with `callback(image, dirtyRect)` when there is a presentation
event.

The `image` is an instance of [NativeImage](native-image.md) that stores the
captured frame.

The `dirtyRect` is an object with `x, y, width, height` properties that
describes which part of the page was repainted. If `onlyDirty` is set to
`true`, `image` will only contain the repainted area. `onlyDirty` defaults to
`false`.

#### `contents.endFrameSubscription()`

Returns `string` - Returns the WebRTC IP Handling Policy.

#### `contents.setWebRTCIPHandlingPolicy(policy)`

* `policy` string - Specify the WebRTC IP Handling Policy.
  * `default` - Exposes user's public and local IPs. This is the default
  behavior. When this policy is used, WebRTC has the right to enumerate all
  interfaces and bind them to discover public interfaces.
  * `default_public_interface_only` - Exposes user's public IP, but does not
  expose user's local IP. When this policy is used, WebRTC should only use the
  default route used by http. This doesn't expose any local addresses.
  * `default_public_and_private_interfaces` - Exposes user's public and local
  IPs. When this policy is used, WebRTC should only use the default route used
  by http. This also exposes the associated default private address. Default
  route is the route chosen by the OS on a multi-homed endpoint.
  * `disable_non_proxied_udp` - Does not expose public or local IPs. When this
  policy is used, WebRTC should only use TCP to contact peers or servers unless
  the proxy server supports UDP.

Setting the WebRTC IP handling policy allows you to control which IPs are
exposed via WebRTC. See [BrowserLeaks](https://browserleaks.com/webrtc) for
more details.

#### `contents.getWebRTCUDPPortRange()`

Returns `Object`:

* `min` Integer - The minimum UDP port number that WebRTC should use.
* `max` Integer - The maximum UDP port number that WebRTC should use.

By default this value is `{ min: 0, max: 0 }` , which would apply no restriction on the udp port range.

#### `contents.setWebRTCUDPPortRange(udpPortRange)`

* `udpPortRange` Object
  * `min` Integer - The minimum UDP port number that WebRTC should use.
  * `max` Integer - The maximum UDP port number that WebRTC should use.

Setting the WebRTC UDP Port Range allows you to restrict the udp port range used by WebRTC. By default the port range is unrestricted.
**Note:** To reset to an unrestricted port range this value should be set to `{ min: 0, max: 0 }`.

#### `contents.getMediaSourceId(requestWebContents)`

* `requestWebContents` WebContents - Web contents that the id will be registered to.

Returns `string` - The identifier of a WebContents stream. This identifier can be used
with `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` using a `chromeMediaSource` of `tab`.
The identifier is restricted to the web contents that it is registered to and is only valid for 10 seconds.

#### `contents.getOSProcessId()`

Returns `Integer` - The operating system `pid` of the associated renderer
process.

#### `contents.getProcessId()`

Returns `Integer` - The Chromium internal `pid` of the associated renderer. Can
be compared to the `frameProcessId` passed by frame specific navigation events
(e.g. `did-frame-navigate`)

#### `contents.takeHeapSnapshot(filePath)`

```YAML history
changes:
  - pr-url: https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/38924

    breaking-changes-header: behavior-changed-webcontentsbackgroundthrottling-set-to-false-affects-all-webcontents-in-the-host-browserwindow
```
-->

* `allowed` boolean

Controls whether or not this WebContents will throttle animations and timers
when the page becomes backgrounded. This also affects the Page Visibility API.

#### `contents.getType()`

Returns `string` - the type of the webContent. Can be `backgroundPage`, `window`, `browserView`, `remote`, `webview` or `offscreen`.

#### `contents.setImageAnimationPolicy(policy)`

* `policy` string - Can be `animate`, `animateOnce` or `noAnimation`.

Sets the image animation policy for this webContents.  The policy only affects
_new_ images, existing images that are currently being animated are unaffected.
This is a known limitation in Chromium, you can force image animation to be
recalculated with `img.src = img.src` which will result in no network traffic
but will update the animation policy.

This corresponds to the [animationPolicy][] accessibility feature in Chromium.

[animationPolicy]: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/accessibilityFeatures/#property-animationPolicy

### Instance Properties

#### `contents.ipc` _Readonly_

An [`IpcMain`](ipc-main.md) scoped to just IPC messages sent from this
WebContents.

IPC messages sent with `ipcRenderer.send`, `ipcRenderer.sendSync` or
`ipcRenderer.postMessage` will be delivered in the following order:

1. `contents.on('ipc-message')`
2. `contents.mainFrame.on(channel)`
3. `contents.ipc.on(channel)`
4. `ipcMain.on(channel)`

Handlers registered with `invoke` will be checked in the following order. The
first one that is defined will be called, the rest will be ignored.

1. `contents.mainFrame.handle(channel)`
2. `contents.handle(channel)`
3. `ipcMain.handle(channel)`

A handler or event listener registered on the WebContents will receive IPC
messages sent from any frame, including child frames. In most cases, only the
main frame can send IPC messages. However, if the `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames`
option is enabled, it is possible for child frames to send IPC messages also.
In that case, handlers should check the `senderFrame` property of the IPC event
to ensure that the message is coming from the expected frame. Alternatively,
register handlers on the appropriate frame directly using the
[`WebFrameMain.ipc`](web-frame-main.md#frameipc-readonly) interface.

#### `contents.audioMuted`

A `boolean` property that determines whether this page is muted.

#### `contents.userAgent`

A `string` property that determines the user agent for this web page.

#### `contents.zoomLevel`

A `number` property that determines the zoom level for this web contents.

The original size is 0 and each increment above or below represents zooming 20% larger or smaller to default limits of 300% and 50% of original size, respectively. The formula for this is `scale := 1.2 ^ level`.

#### `contents.zoomFactor`

A `number` property that determines the zoom factor for this web contents.

The zoom factor is the zoom percent divided by 100, so 300% = 3.0.

#### `contents.frameRate`

An `Integer` property that sets the frame rate of the web contents to the specified number.
Only values between 1 and 240 are accepted.

Only applicable if _offscreen rendering_ is enabled.
