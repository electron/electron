## How to contribute to addressing issues

### Asking for general help

### Reporting a bug

### Handling a bug report

### Fixing a reported issue

There are three main ways anyone can contribute to resolving issues:

**Opening an issue for discussion:**
If you believe you have found a new bug in Electron, please report it by creating a new issue in the [electron/electron issue tracker](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues).

You can also help prioritize issues by providing supporting information, such as a reproducible test case that demonstrates the problem, or by suggesting possible solutions.

**Helping to resolve an issue:**
This can be done by showing that the issue is not actually a bug or has already been fixed; however, most commonly it involves creating a pull request that introduces specific, reviewable changes to the [electron/electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) source code.

## Asking for general help

The Electron website provides a list of resources for getting programming help, reporting security issues, contributing to development, and more.
Please use the issue tracker **only** for reporting bugs.

## Reporting a bug

To report a bug:

When creating a new issue in the [electron/electron issue tracker](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues), you will be presented with a template that must be filled out.

If you believe you have discovered a bug in Electron, please complete the template and include as much relevant information as possible.

The two most important pieces of information for evaluating a bug report are a clear description of the problem and a simple test case that reproduces it. Bugs are much easier to fix when they can be reproduced.

See:
[How to create a minimal, complete, and verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).

## Handling a bug report

Discussion on open issues is normal. Contributors may have differing opinions, including whether certain behavior is a bug or an intended feature. These discussions are part of the process and should remain focused, constructive, and professional.

Short responses that lack context or supporting details are generally not helpful or professional. Many people find such replies frustrating or unfriendly.

Contributors are encouraged to work together and help each other move forward. If you encounter an issue that you believe is incorrect or contains inaccurate information, explain why you think so and provide supporting evidence. Be open to being corrected as well — this often helps reach the correct outcome more quickly.

## Fixing a reported issue

Most issues are resolved by creating a pull request. The process of creating and reviewing a pull request is similar to filing and triaging issues, but it includes the necessary review and approval workflow to ensure that proposed changes meet the Electron project’s minimum quality and functionality requirements.
