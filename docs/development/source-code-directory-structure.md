# Source Code Directory Structure

The source code of Electron is separated into a few parts, mostly
following Chromium on the separation conventions.

You may need to become familiar with
[Chromium's multi-process architecture](https://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/multi-process-architecture)
to understand the source code better.

## Structure of Source Code

```diff
Electron
├── build/ - Build configuration files needed to build with GN.
├── buildflags/ - Determines the set of features that can be conditionally built.
├── chromium_src/ - Source code copied from Chromium that isn't part of the content layer.

|   |   └── remote/ - Code related to the remote module as it is
|   |                 used in the main process.
|   ├── common/ - Relating to logic needed by both main and renderer processes.
|   |   └── api/ - API implementation for modules that can be used in
|   |              both the main and renderer processes
|   ├── isolated_renderer/ - Handles creation of isolated renderer processes when

|   ├── renderer/ - Renderer process initialization code.
|   |   ├── api/ - API implementation for renderer process modules.
|   |   ├── extension/ - Code related to use of Chrome Extensions
|   |   |                in Electron's renderer process.
|   |   ├── remote/ - Logic that handles use of the remote module in
|   |   |             the main process.
|   |   └── web-view/ - Logic that handles the use of webviews in the
|   |                   renderer process.
|   ├── sandboxed_renderer/ - Logic that handles creation of sandboxed renderer
|   |   |                     processes.
|   |   └── api/ - API implementation for sandboxed renderer processes.
|   └── worker/ - Logic that handles proper functionality of Node.js
|                 environments in Web Workers.
├── patches/ - Patches applied on top of Electron's core dependencies
|   |          in order to handle differences between our use cases and
|   |          default functionality.
|   ├── boringssl/ - Patches applied to Google's fork of OpenSSL, BoringSSL.
|   ├── chromium/ - Patches applied to Chromium.
|   ├── node/ - Patches applied on top of Node.js.
|   └── v8/ - Patches applied on top of Google's V8 engine.
├── shell/ - C++ source code.
|   ├── app/ - System entry code.
|   ├── browser/ - The frontend including the main window, UI, and all of the
|   |   |          main process things. This talks to the renderer to manage web
|   |   |          pages.
|   |   ├── ui/ - Implementation of UI stuff for different platforms.
|   |   |   ├── cocoa/ - Cocoa specific source code.
|   |   |   ├── win/ - Windows GUI specific source code.

|   |   ├── net/ - Network related code.
|   |   ├── mac/ - Mac specific Objective-C source code.
|   |   └── resources/ - Icons, platform-dependent files, etc.
|   ├── renderer/ - Code that runs in renderer process.
|   |   └── api/ - The implementation of renderer process APIs.
|   └── common/ - Code that used by both the main and renderer processes,
|       |         including some utility functions and code to integrate node's
|       |         message loop into Chromium's message loop.
|       └── api/ - The implementation of common APIs, and foundations of
|                  Electron's built-in modules.
├── spec/ - Components of Electron's test suite run in the main process.
└── BUILD.gn - Building rules of Electron.
