# Electron Release Timelines

* The `-beta.1` and `stable` dates are our solid release dates.
* We strive for weekly beta releases, however we often release more betas than scheduled.
* All dates are our goals but there may be reasons for adjusting the stable deadline, such as security bugs.
* Take a look at the [5.0.0 Timeline blog post](https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-5-0-timeline) for info about publicizing our release dates.
