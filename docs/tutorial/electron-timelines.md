# Electron Release Timelines

Special notes:

* The `-beta.1` and `stable` dates are our solid release dates.
* We strive for weekly beta releases, however we often release more betas than scheduled.
* All dates are our goals but there may be reasons for adjusting the stable deadline, such as security bugs.
* Take a look at the [5.0.0 Timeline blog post](https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-5-0-timeline) for info about publicizing our release dates.
* Since Electron 6.0, we've been targeting every other Chromium version and releasing our stable on the same day as Chrome stable. You can reference Chromium's release schedule [here](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule). See [Electron's new release cadence blog post](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/12-week-cadence) for more details on our release schedule.
* Starting in Electron 16.0, we will release on an 8-week cadence. See [Electron's new 8-week cadence blog post](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/8-week-cadence) for more details.
