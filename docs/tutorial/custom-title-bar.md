# Custom Title Bar

## Basic tutorial

Application windows have a default [chrome][] applied by the OS. Not to be confused
with the Google Chrome browser, window _chrome_ refers to the parts of the window (e.g.
title bar, toolbars, controls) that are not a part of the main web content. While the
default title bar provided by the OS chrome is sufficient for simple use cases, many
applications opt to remove it. Implementing a custom title bar can help your application
feel more modern and consistent across platforms.

You can follow along with this tutorial by opening Fiddle with the following starter code.

```fiddle docs/fiddles/features/window-customization/custom-title-bar/starter-code

```

### Remove the default title bar

Let’s start by configuring a window with native window controls and a hidden title bar.
To remove the default title bar, set the [`BaseWindowContructorOptions`][] `titleBarStyle`
param in the `BrowserWindow` constructor to `'hidden'`.

```fiddle docs/fiddles/features/window-customization/custom-title-bar/remove-title-bar

```

### Add native window controls _Windows_ _Linux_

On macOS, setting `titleBarStyle: 'hidden'` removes the title bar while keeping the window’s
traffic light controls available in the upper left hand corner. However on Windows and Linux,
you’ll need to add window controls back into your `BrowserWindow` by setting the
[`BaseWindowContructorOptions`][] `titleBarOverlay` param in the `BrowserWindow` constructor.

```fiddle docs/fiddles/features/window-customization/custom-title-bar/native-window-controls

```

Setting `titleBarOverlay: true` is the simplest way to expose window controls back into
your `BrowserWindow`. If you’re interested in customizing the window controls further,
check out the sections [Custom traffic lights][] and [Custom window controls][] that cover
this in more detail.

### Create a custom title bar

Now, let’s implement a simple custom title bar in the `webContents` of our `BrowserWindow`.
There’s nothing fancy here, just HTML and CSS!

```fiddle docs/fiddles/features/window-customization/custom-title-bar/custom-title-bar

```

Currently our application window can’t be moved. Since we’ve removed the default title bar,
the application needs to tell Electron which regions are draggable. We’ll do this by adding
the CSS style `app-region: drag` to the custom title bar. Now we can drag the custom title
bar to reposition our app window!

```fiddle docs/fiddles/features/window-customization/custom-title-bar/custom-drag-region

```

For more information around how to manage drag regions defined by your electron application,
see the [Custom draggable regions][] section below.

Congratulations, you've just implemented a basic custom title bar!

## Advanced window customization

### Custom traffic lights _macOS_

#### Customize the look of your traffic lights _macOS_

The `customButtonsOnHover` title bar style will hide the traffic lights until you hover
over them. This is useful if you want to create custom traffic lights in your HTML but still
use the native UI to control the window.

```js
const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

const win = new BrowserWindow({ titleBarStyle: 'customButtonsOnHover' })
```

#### Customize the traffic light position _macOS_

To modify the position of the traffic light window controls, there are two configuration
options available.

Applying `hiddenInset` title bar style will shift the vertical inset of the traffic lights
by a fixed amount.

```js title='main.js'
const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

const win = new BrowserWindow({ titleBarStyle: 'hiddenInset' })
```

If you need more granular control over the positioning of the traffic lights, you can pass
a set of coordinates to the `trafficLightPosition` option in the `BrowserWindow`
constructor.

```js title='main.js'
const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

const win = new BrowserWindow({
  titleBarStyle: 'hidden',
  trafficLightPosition: { x: 10, y: 10 }
})
```

#### Show and hide the traffic lights programmatically _macOS_

You can also show and hide the traffic lights programmatically from the main process.
The `win.setWindowButtonVisibility` forces traffic lights to be show or hidden depending
on the value of its boolean parameter.

```js title='main.js'
const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

const win = new BrowserWindow()
// hides the traffic lights
win.setWindowButtonVisibility(false)
```

:::note
Given the number of APIs available, there are many ways of achieving this. For instance,
combining `frame: false` with `win.setWindowButtonVisibility(true)` will yield the same
layout outcome as setting `titleBarStyle: 'hidden'`.
:::

#### Custom window controls

The [Window Controls Overlay API][] is a web standard that gives web apps the ability to
customize their title bar region when installed on desktop. Electron exposes this API
through the `titleBarOverlay` option in the `BrowserWindow` constructor. When `titleBarOverlay`
is enabled, the window controls become exposed in their default position, and DOM elements
cannot use the area underneath this region.

:::note
`titleBarOverlay` requires the `titleBarStyle` param in the `BrowserWindow` constructor
to have a value other than `default`.
:::

The custom title bar tutorial covers a [basic example][Add native window controls] of exposing
window controls by setting `titleBarOverlay: true`. The height, color (_Windows_ _Linux_), and
symbol colors (_Windows_) of the window controls can be customized further by setting
`titleBarOverlay` to an object.

The value passed to the `height` property must be an integer. The `color` and `symbolColor`
properties accept `rgba()`, `hsla()`, and `#RRGGBBAA` color formats and support transparency.
If a color option is not specified, the color will default to its system color for the window
control buttons. Similarly, if the height option is not specified, the window controls will
default to the standard system height:

```js title='main.js'
const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

const win = new BrowserWindow({
  titleBarStyle: 'hidden',
  titleBarOverlay: {
    color: '#2f3241',
    symbolColor: '#74b1be',
    height: 60
  }
})
```

:::note
Once your title bar overlay is enabled from the main process, you can access the overlay's
color and dimension values from a renderer using a set of readonly
[JavaScript APIs][overlay-javascript-apis] and [CSS Environment Variables][overlay-css-env-vars].
