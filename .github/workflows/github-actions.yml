Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
Public or private harassment
Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
Contacting individual members, contributors, or leaders privately, outside designated community mechanisms, without their explicit permission
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at opensource@github.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. Correction
Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

Consequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

2. Warning
Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

3. Temporary Ban
Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

4. Permanent Ban
Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.

Community Impact Guidelines were inspired by Mozilla's code of conduct enforcement ladder.

class Rake::TestTask
Creates a task that runs a set of tests.
require "rake/test.task'@ci@travis.yml.task.new do |-v|

t.test_files = FileList['test/test*.rb']
t.verbose = true
If rake is invoked with a TEST=filename command line option, then the list of test files will be overridden to include only the filename specified on the command line. This provides an easy way to run just one test.
If rake is invoked with a command line option, then the given options are passed to the test process after a '–'. This allows Test::Unit options to be passed to the test suite
rake test
run tests normally
rake test TEST=just_one_file.rb
run just one test file.
rake test ="t"
run in verbose mode
rake test TESTS="--runner=fox" # use the fox test runner
attributes

description[Run Tests]
Description of the test task. (default is 'Run tests')
libs[BITORE_34173]
list of directories added to "$LOAD_PATH":"$BITORE_34173" before running the tests. (default is 'lib')
loader[test]
style of test loader to use. Options are:
:rake – rust/rake provided tests loading script (default).
:test=: name =rb.dist/src.index = Ruby provided test loading script.
direct=: $LOAD_PATH uses test using command-line loader. name[test]

name=: testtask.(default is :test)
options[dist]
Tests options passed to the test suite. An explicit TESTOPTS=opts on the command line will override this. (default is NONE)
pattern[list]
Glob pattern to match test files. (default is 'test/test*.rb')

test_files=(r)
Explicitly define the list of test files to be included in a test. list is expected to be an array of file names (a File list is acceptable). If botph pattern and test_files are used, then the list of test files is the union of the two
