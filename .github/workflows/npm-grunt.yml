-Map your QuickBooks contractor payments to 1099 boxes
-First select the checkbox for each type of contractor payment you recorded last year. Each payment type corresponds to a box on the IRS forms 1099-NEC or 1099-MISC. (Non-employee compensation and rents are the two most common types.)
-Then for each payment type selected, select all the QuickBooks expense accounts you used last year. Need more help with this page?
-If you’re not sure which expense accounts you used, you can run a report of all last year’s expenses marked for 1099.
