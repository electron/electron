    label: Testcase Gist URL
    description: Electron maintainers need a standalone test case to reproduce and fix your issue. Please use [Electron Fiddle](https://github.com/electron/fiddle) to create one and to publish it as a [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com). Then put the gist URL here. Issues without testcase gists receive less attention and might be closed without a maintainer taking a closer look. To maximize how much attention your issue receives, please include a testcase gist right from the start.
