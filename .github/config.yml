  ### Semantic PR titles

  We use [semantic commit messages](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/docs/development/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines) to streamline the release process. Before your pull request can be merged, you should **update your pull request title** to start with a semantic prefix.

  Examples of commit messages with semantic prefixes:

  - `fix: don't overwrite prevent_default if default wasn't prevented`
  - `feat: add app.isPackaged() method`
  - `docs: app.isDefaultProtocolClient is now available on Linux`

  ### Commit signing

  This repo enforces [commit signatures](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) for all incoming PRs.
  To sign your commits, see GitHub's documentation on [Telling Git about your signing key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key).
  
  ### PR tips

  Things that will help get your PR across the finish line:

  - Follow the JavaScript, C++, and Python [coding style](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/docs/development/coding-style.md).
  - Run `npm run lint` locally to catch formatting errors earlier.
  - Document any user-facing changes you've made following the [documentation styleguide](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/docs/styleguide.md).
  - Include tests when adding/changing behavior.
  - Include screenshots and animated GIFs whenever possible.
