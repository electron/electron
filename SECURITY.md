# Reporting Security Issues

The Electron team and community take security bugs in Electron seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email [security@electronjs.org](mailto:security@electronjs.org) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

The Electron team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".

## The Electron Security Notification Process

For context on Electron's security notification process, please see the [Notifications](https://github.com/electron/governance/blob/main/wg-security/membership-and-notifications.md#notifications) section of the Security WG's [Membership and Notifications](https://github.com/electron/governance/blob/main/wg-security/membership-and-notifications.md) Governance document.
